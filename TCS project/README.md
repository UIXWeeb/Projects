#  DEVELOPING WEB APPLICATION ON AWS

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description

Traditional on-premises web architectures require complex solutions and accurate reserved capacity forecast in order to ensure reliability. Dense peak traffic periods and wild swings in traffic patterns result in low utilization rates of expensive hardware. This yields high operating costs to maintain idle hardware, and an inefficient use of capital for underused hardware. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a reliable, scalable, secure, and highly performing infrastructure for the most demanding web applications. This infrastructure matches IT costs with customer traffic patterns in nearreal time.

## Project Objective and Brief

When you are responsible for running a web application, you could face a variety of infrastructure and architectural issues for which AWS can provide seamless and cost-effective solutions. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a reliable, scalable, secure, and highly performing infrastructure for the most demanding web applications. By leveraging AWS services, you can match IT costs with customer traffic patterns in near-real time, leading to improved efficiency and reduced operating costs compared to traditional hosting models.

The objective of this project is to develop a web application on AWS, showcasing the benefits and capabilities of AWS services. The project includes the creation of a static website hosted on AWS S3, as well as a dynamic web application hosted on AWS EC2, leveraging the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) capabilities. Additionally, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is used to configure networking components for enhanced security and control.

By following this project, you will gain hands-on experience in utilizing AWS services for web application hosting, understanding the advantages of cloud infrastructure, and implementing cost-effective solutions for your web applications.

## Features

- Static Website Hosting using AWS S3
- Dynamic Web Application hosting and configuration using AWS EC2 and VPC
- Integration of frontend technologies like HTML
- Backend implementation with PHP
- Efficient utilization of AWS services for cost-effectiveness and scalability

## Technologies Used

- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- HTML5
- PHP
- Git, GitHub

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aravinthkrishna-ace/Projects.git`
2. Set up AWS credentials and configure AWS services accordingly.
3. Install dependencies:
   - For the static website, no additional dependencies are required.
   - For the dynamic web application, ensure Node.js and PHP are installed on the hosting environment.
4. Customize and configure the web application as per your requirements.

   - For the static website, replace the contents of the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and other static files with your own content.
   - For the dynamic web application, update the necessary configuration files and scripts according to your application logic.

5. Deploy the web application to the appropriate AWS services:
   - For the static website, upload the static files to an S3 bucket and configure it for static website hosting. Access the website via the provided S3 bucket URL.
   - For the dynamic web application, launch an EC2 instance, configure networking components using VPC, and install any required packages. Deploy the web application code and access it through the public IP or domain assigned to the EC2 instance.

6. Test the functionality of your web application and make any necessary adjustments.

## Usage

1. For the static website, upload the static files to an S3 bucket and configure it for static website hosting. Access the website via the provided S3 bucket URL.
2. For the dynamic web application, launch an EC2 instance, configure networking components using VPC, and install required packages. Deploy the web application code and access it through the public IP or domain assigned to the EC2 instance.
